Thank you for contributing to GraphQL-core!

If your pull-request is non-trivial, adds a feature or contains a non-breaking change,
then please, first open an issue to discuss the proposed changes and add a link to it.

GraphQL-core tries very hard to stay within the scope of being just a Python port
of [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js).

Any additional feature  or incompatible change will be only accepted in rare cases
and require compelling reasons, because they aggravate maintenance and synchronization
with the developments in the upstream project. So please discuss such changes upfront
in an issue before sending a PR. Maybe there are other ways to solve the problem.

If possible, also add unit tests, or provide runnable example code as part of the
accompanying issue, from which unit tests can be derived.
