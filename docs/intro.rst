Introduction
============

`GraphQL-core-next`_ is a Python port of `GraphQL.js`_,
the JavaScript reference implementation for GraphQL_,
a query language for APIs created by Facebook.

.. attention:: GraphQL-core-next has been deprecated.
   It is now released as GraphQL-core v3 and newer.

`GraphQL`_ consists of three parts:

* A type system that you define
* A query language that you use to query the API
* An execution and validation engine

The reference implementation closely follows the `Specification for GraphQL`_
which consists of the following sections:

* Language_
* `Type System`_
* Introspection_
* Validation_
* Execution_
* Response_

This division into subsections is reflected in the :ref:`sub-packages` of
GraphQL-core-next. Each of these sub-packages implements the aspects specified in
one of the sections of the specification.


Getting started
---------------

You can install GraphQL-core-next using pip_::

    pip install graphql-core-next

You can also install GraphQL-core-next with pipenv_, if you prefer that::

    pipenv install graphql-core-next

Now you can start using GraphQL-core-next by importing from the top-level
:mod:`graphql` package. Nearly everything defined in the sub-packages
can also be imported directly from the top-level package.

.. currentmodule:: graphql

For instance, using the types defined in the :mod:`graphql.type` package,
you can define a GraphQL schema, like this simple one::

    from graphql import (
        GraphQLSchema, GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLField, GraphQLString)

    schema = GraphQLSchema(
        query=GraphQLObjectType(
            name='RootQueryType',
            fields={
                'hello': GraphQLField(
                    GraphQLString,
                    resolve=lambda obj, info: 'world')
            }))

The :mod:`graphql.execution` package implements the mechanism for executing
GraphQL queries. The top-level :func:`graphql` and :func:`graphql_sync`
functions also parse and validate queries using the :mod:`graphql.language`
and :mod:`graphql.validation` modules.

So to validate and execute a query against our simple schema, you can do::

    from graphql import graphql_sync

    query = '{ hello }'

    print(graphql_sync(schema, query))

This will yield the following output::

    ExecutionResult(data={'hello': 'world'}, errors=None)
