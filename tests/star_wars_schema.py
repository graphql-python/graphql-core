"""Star Wars GraphQL schema

This is designed to be an end-to-end test, demonstrating the full GraphQL stack.

We will create a GraphQL schema that describes the major characters in the original
Star Wars trilogy.

NOTE: This may contain spoilers for the original Star Wars trilogy.

Using our shorthand to describe type systems, the type system for our Star Wars example
is::

    enum Episode { NEWHOPE, EMPIRE, JEDI }

    interface Character {
      id: String!
      name: String
      friends: [Character]
      appearsIn: [Episode]
    }

    type Human implements Character {
      id: String!
      name: String
      friends: [Character]
      appearsIn: [Episode]
      homePlanet: String
    }

    type Droid implements Character {
      id: String!
      name: String
      friends: [Character]
      appearsIn: [Episode]
      primaryFunction: String
    }

    type Query {
      hero(episode: Episode): Character
      human(id: String!): Human
      droid(id: String!): Droid
    }
